  ### 8. Memory Management : Understand how Dart's garbage collection works. Learn best practices for managing memory in Dart applications. Explore tools and techniques for profiling and optimizing memory usage.
  ### 9. Dart Native and FFI : Learn how to call native C/C++ code from Dart using FFI. Understand the setup and use cases for integrating native libraries. Practice writing FFI bindings and using them in Dart applications.
  ### 10. Code Generation : Learn about Dart's build system (`build_runner`) and how to create code generators. Understand the concept of source generation and how it can automate repetitive tasks. Practice writing simple code generators and integrating them into your project.
  ### 11. Packages and Plugins: Learn how to create reusable Dart packages. Understand the structure of a Dart package and how to publish it to pub.dev. Explore best practices for package development and versioning.
  ### 12. Testing and Debugging: Learn about mocking, stubbing, and integration testing. Understand how to use testing frameworks like `Mockito` for writing unit tests. Explore debugging techniques and tools to troubleshoot complex issues.
  ### 13. Dart for Web and Server: Learn about compiling Dart to JavaScript and using it for web development. Explore the `dart:html` library for interacting with the DOM. Practice building and deploying Dart web applications.
- **Dart for Server**: Understand how to use Dart for server-side development with frameworks like Aqueduct or Angel.
  - Learn about setting up a server, routing, and handling HTTP requests.
